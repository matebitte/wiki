vv01f made me aware of the issue and told me to set the permission-policy header to block FLoC.

The easiest way I found is to edit your .htaccess file and add this line:

````
Header set Permission-Policy: interest-cohort=()
````

<br>

stuebinm pointed out that you can do that in nginx with: 

```
add_header Permissions-Policy "interest-cohort=()";
```

<br>

if you know of different circumstances that need different solutions, feel free to add them :)
