# Privacy focused eMail

TL,DR: eMail is a shitty protocol, even encrypted mail sucks. Depending on the usecase, go use briar, signal or [[matrix]].    
If you have to use eMail, be careful: even "secure" providers like protonmail may be legally forced to corrupt your security.   

--> Look for a local tech collective like systemli or riseup.

### Basic terms

You should know what those are:

- e2ee -> end to end encryption
- ZKA -> zero-knowledge-architecture
- IMAP/SMTP -> protocols used to recieve and send mail with mail clients
- mail client (eg: thunderbird, Postbox, FairEmail) -> email program
- prices are per month with a monthly billing cycle

## Classic Freemail

e.g.: Google Mail, Microsoft Outlook, Apple iCloud, yahoo-mail

DO NOT USE **ANY** OF THOSE!
There are many explanaitions online why you shouldnt.

## Selfhosted

### Own server, own domain

- A fucking PAIN in the ass to maintain
- usually a security nightmare
- domain can be easily linked to you
- will be IP blocked by most spam filters

--> DONT DO IT, unless you know 200% what you are doing

### Included with webhosting

- hosting websites =/= hosting mail -> still not very secure
- domain is still tied to you
- pgp is always possible
- imap is always possible

but overall still better than freemail
