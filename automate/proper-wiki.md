# Building a Markdown knowledge base
Ive got a pile of Markdown files id like to form into a working knowledge base without too much effort.

## Github pages and Jekyll themes
all of them are bloated, but those seem to be the best:

### Just the Docs
modern, highly customizable, and responsive with search.

### Help Center
Simple and responsive Jekyll theme for help center.

But, to be honest, all of them suck. Another alternative:

## Gitlab Pages
...can really do anything. Like for example

* https://pages.gitlab.io/emscripten/
* https://docusaurus.io/
* https://www.gatsbyjs.com/

now that's much more flexibility, and even id I decide to stick with jekyll, the flexibility is much greater. Neat!

But with some digging, i think I found the [holy grale](https://gatsby-project-kb.vercel.app/) with Gitlab pages + Gatsby.
