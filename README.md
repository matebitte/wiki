# Wiki

Over time, I looked up, learned and created some things for various reasons or projects.

More importantly, I implemented certain things for some reason and id like to make the process as clear as possible to anyone who may ever have to maintain infrastructure set up by myself.

View this as my part to kill (unintended) knowledge hierarchies :)

### internal links
In case you are wondering WTF those numbers are: they are internal links used by [zettlr](zettlr.com).

### Languages
My default will be english, but in case I accidentally wrote in German (*-de.md), im not going to spend time translating. Use [deepl](deepl.com).

For my fellow germans: blabliblub-de.md zeigt dass die Datei auf Deutsch ist. Auch hier der Hinweis, dass [deepl](deepl.com) existiert.
